# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# users = User.create(
#     [{ 
#         name: 'Star Wars',
#         password: "11111111",
#         email: "anish111@mail5.net"
#     },
#     { 
#         name: 'Lord of the Rings',
#         password: "11111111",
#         email: "anish112@mail5.net"
